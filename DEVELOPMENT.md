# Development Roadmap

This document highlights potential improvements and enhancements for the Docker Backup and Restore scripts.

---

## Planned Enhancements
1. **Support for Stopped Containers**:
   - Modify the backup script to include stopped containers by using:
     ```bash
     docker ps -aq
     ```

2. **Incremental Backups**:
   - Implement logic to detect and back up only changed files within volumes.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Add robust error-checking to handle edge cases, such as:
     - Missing volume directories.
     - Insufficient disk space.

4. **Logging**:
   - Integrate a logging system to record backup and restore processes, errors, and successes.

5. **Restore Confirmation**:
   - Add a confirmation prompt before overwriting existing containers or volumes during restoration.

6. **Support for Docker Compose**:
   - Enhance the backup process to save `docker-compose.yml` files for multi-container setups.

7. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
   - Test and adapt the scripts for compatibility with macOS and Windows systems.

## Open Ideas
- Add a feature to back up and restore network configurations.
- Create a Docker container to run the scripts in isolation.
- Build a GUI for non-technical users to manage backups and restores.
